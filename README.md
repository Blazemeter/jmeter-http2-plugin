This plugin provides a `bzm - HTTP Sampler` (multi-protocol: **HTTP/1.1**, **HTTP/2**, **HTTP/3 (QUIC)**) and **`bzm - HTTP Async Controller`** so multiple BlazeMeter HTTP samplers can run **overlapped in time** (concurrent sampler execution controlled by that controller—not the same thing as HTTP/2 stream multiplexing on the wire). If your test plan already uses JMeter’s standard **HTTP Request** sampler, you can **convert those elements to `bzm - HTTP Sampler`** in a few clicks—see **[Migrate from JMeter HTTP Request to BlazeMeter HTTP](#readme-migrate-jmeter-http-request)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires **Java 17+**

> [!NOTE]
> **Compatibility:** Use **Java** and **Apache JMeter** versions that are **supported together** for the JMeter release you run. Through **JMeter 5.6.3**, JMeter does **not** support **Java** versions **newer than 21** — use **Java 17** or **Java 21** with those JMeter lines unless your vendor documents otherwise. For newer JMeter versions, follow Apache’s prerequisites in **[Getting Started](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html)** and the release notes for that version.

<a id="readme-install"></a>

<a id="readme-prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

1. **[Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)** installed and runnable with a **Java** version that matches that JMeter release (see the **Important** / **Note** alerts at the top of this README).
2. **[JMeter Plugins Manager](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/how-install-jmeter-plugins-manager)** installed inside JMeter. Plugins Manager is the usual way to add and update community plugins such as this one.

> [!NOTE]
> Install this plugin via **Plugins Manager** when possible. Start from the prerequisites, then install, verify, and update as needed.


<a id="readme-install-plugins-manager"></a>
## Installation using Plugins Manager

1. Start **JMeter** and open **Plugins Manager** (typically **Options → Plugins Manager** depending on your JMeter build).
2. Open the **Available Plugins** tab and search for **BlazeMeter HTTP**.
3. Select it, click **Apply Changes and Restart JMeter**, and wait for the install to finish.



<a id="readme-updating"></a>
## Updating

If the plugin is already installed, open **Plugins Manager → Installed Plugins**, find the same entry, and install updates when offered (then restart JMeter when prompted), same as other Plugins Manager extensions.


<a id="readme-manual-installation"></a>
## Manual installation

Use this path when Plugins Manager is not an option—for example offline installs.

1. Open **[Releases](https://github.com/Blazemeter/jmeter-http2-plugin/releases)** for this repository and choose the plugin version that matches your JMeter line (the **Latest** tag is usually the right default).
2. Under **Assets** for that release, download **`jmeter-bzm-http2-<version>.jar`**.
3. Copy **`jmeter-bzm-http2-<version>.jar`** into **`<JMETER_HOME>/lib/ext`**.
4. **Restart JMeter**.


<a id="readme-verifying-installation"></a>
## Verifying the installation

1. In **Plugins Manager → Installed Plugins**, confirm the BlazeMeter HTTP plugin is listed.
2. In a test plan: **Add → Sampler** and check that **`bzm - HTTP Sampler`** is available. Optionally **Add → Logic Controller** and verify **`bzm - HTTP Async Controller`**.

To build the JAR yourself from this repository, see **[Building from source](#readme-building-from-source)** below.


<a id="readme-migrate-jmeter-http-request"></a>
## Migrate from JMeter HTTP Request to BlazeMeter HTTP

If your plan uses Apache JMeter’s standard **HTTP Request** sampler, convert those elements to **`bzm - HTTP Sampler`** to use **HTTP/1.1**, **HTTP/2**, and **HTTP/3** from this plugin. 

The tool replaces **HTTP Request → BlazeMeter HTTP** in the test tree.

![Migrate HTTP Request samplers to BlazeMeter HTTP](docs/migrate-http-to-blazemeter-http.gif)

<a id="readme-migrate-when"></a>
### When to use it

Use this path when:

- Your `.jmx` drives HTTP traffic with JMeter’s stock **HTTP Request** sampler (tree label **HTTP Request**; element type `HTTPSamplerProxy`, or legacy `HTTPSampler` on very old plans).
- You want **`bzm - HTTP Sampler`** and its multi-protocol client (**HTTP/1.1**, **HTTP/2**, **HTTP/3**, profiles, Jetty behavior) **without** manually re-adding every request.
- You are **not** starting from a blank plan (for that, see [Creating the Test Plan](#readme-creating-test-plan) below).


<a id="readme-migrate-how"></a>
### How to run migration

Open **Tools → BlazeMeter HTTP** and choose one of:

| Menu item | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Migrate Entire Test Plan (HTTP Request → BlazeMeter HTTP)…** | Scans the whole tree and replaces every migratable **HTTP Request** sampler after confirmation. |
| **Migrate Selected (HTTP Request → BlazeMeter HTTP)…** | Replaces only selected tree nodes that qualify; non-HTTP selections are listed as skipped in the confirm dialog. |

**Recommended flow:**

1. [Install and verify](#readme-verifying-installation) the plugin.
2. Open your `.jmx` in JMeter (**stop any running test** before migrating).
3. **Save a backup** of the test plan—migration **cannot be undone**.
4. **Tools → BlazeMeter HTTP →** run **Migrate Entire Test Plan…** or **Migrate Selected…**.
5. Confirm the sampler count in the dialog.
6. Review migrated **`bzm - HTTP Sampler`** nodes; tune **Advanced → Client Behavior** (profiles, HTTP/2, HTTP/3) as needed.
7. Save the updated `.jmx`.

> [!NOTE] **Preserved during migration:**
>
> - **Sampler settings** from the original HTTP Request (URL, method, body, timeouts, redirects, etc.)—properties are copied; only the GUI/test class names change to BlazeMeter HTTP.
> - **Child elements** under each HTTP Request (assertions, timers, preprocessors, etc.)—they stay attached under the new sampler.
> - **Tree position**—same parent and index in the test plan.
> - **Selection**—after a batch migration, tree selection is restored to the new nodes where possible.

<a id="readme-creating-test-plan"></a>
# Creating the Test Plan

> **Already using JMeter’s standard HTTP Request sampler?** **[Migrate from JMeter HTTP Request to BlazeMeter HTTP](#readme-migrate-jmeter-http-request)**.  
> **No script yet?** Pick an option below.

<a id="readme-option-a-recording"></a>
### Option A: Recording (JMeter HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder)

This plugin can act as a sampler creator during JMeter proxy recording; it is **enabled by default**.

1. Use JMeter’s [**HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder**](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_proxy_step_by_step.html) as usual.

2. As the elements are recorded, the plugin creates the BlazeMeter HTTP Sampler automatically.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To disable recording support, use **Tools → BlazeMeter HTTP → Disable Recording with HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder** (restart when prompted).
> You can also set `blazemeter.http.proxy_enabled=false` in `user.properties` (legacy `HTTP2Sampler.proxy_enabled` is accepted too).
> The recorder creates `bzm - HTTP Sampler` elements, but you may still want to adjust protocol/profile settings afterwards.


<a id="readme-option-b-correlation"></a>
### Option B: Recording with BlazeMeter Automatic Correlation Recorder

This plugin is also compatible with the BlazeMeter Automatic Correlation Recorder recording method.

For more information: [BlazeMeter Automatic Correlation Recorder - Installing the Plugin](https://blazemeter.github.io/CorrelationRecorder/guide/installation-guide.html#prerequisites)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Since BlazeMeter Automatic Correlation Recorder inherits and is compatible with the JMeter recorder, the process of enabling and disabling Recording support is the same as the method documented in Option A.


<a id="readme-option-c-manual"></a>
### Option C: Manual setup

1. Create a Thread Group.

2. Add the HTTP Sampler (Add → Sampler → bzm - HTTP Sampler).

![](docs/addHTTP2Sampler.png)

3. Configure the sampler URL + client behavior (profile/protocols) as described below.
4. Add timers, assertions, listeners, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Where possible the sampler aligns with behaviors you know from JMeter’s **HTTP Request**. There are deliberate differences wherever multi-protocol negotiation, QUIC, or the Jetty client requires them.

<a id="readme-http-sampler"></a>
# HTTP Sampler

The sampler UI has two tabs: **Basic** (URL + request basics) and **Advanced** (client behavior + timeouts/proxy/embedded resources).

<a id="readme-http-sampler-basic"></a>
### Basic tab

![](docs/http2Sampler-basic.png)

This is the standard JMeter URL configuration panel (domain, port, path, method, redirects, body, etc.).

| **Field** | **Description** | **Default** |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol | `http` or `https` (URL scheme). This is independent from HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3 negotiation. | `http` |
| Server name or IP | Target host (no `http://` prefix). | |
| Port number | Target port. | `80` for http, `443` for https |
| Method | Standard HTTP methods supported by JMeter. | `GET` |
| Path | Path + query (e.g. `/api/v1/items?limit=10`). | `/` |
| Content encoding | Character encoding used for request body (unrelated to HTTP `Content-Encoding` header). | |
| Redirect Automatically / Follow Redirects | Same semantics as JMeter’s HTTP Request sampler. | |
| Use KeepAlive | Reuse connections when possible (same semantics as JMeter’s HTTP Request sampler). | |
| Browser-compatible headers | Add headers that mimic common browser behavior (same semantics as JMeter’s HTTP Request sampler). | |
| Use multipart/form-data | Same semantics as JMeter’s HTTP Request sampler. | |



<a id="readme-http-sampler-advanced"></a>
### Advanced tab

![](docs/http2Sampler-advanced.png)


<a id="readme-client-profile"></a>
#### Client Behavior → Profile

A **profile** is a named bundle of protocol defaults (which protocols are enabled, whether ALPN is enabled, fallback/caches, and timings). Profiles make it easy to mimic “how browsers behave” vs “legacy compatibility”.

The available profiles are:

- **Browser-like (Most Browsers)** (`browser-like`) (default)
- **Browser-compatible (Other Browsers)** (`browser-compatible`)
- **Legacy / Older Systems** (`legacy`)
- **Browser-like (Custom)** (`browser-like-custom`) (persists per-sampler toggles below)

You can also define additional profiles in `user.properties` / `jmeter.properties`.
Custom profiles are loaded by both the GUI and non-GUI runtime, so the same profile
works in local, CLI, and distributed test runs.

Example:

```properties
blazemeter.http.profiles.mobile-h3.label=Mobile H3 Conservative
blazemeter.http.profiles.mobile-h3.extends=browser-like
blazemeter.http.profiles.mobile-h3.enableHttp3=true
blazemeter.http.profiles.mobile-h3.enableHttp2=true
blazemeter.http.profiles.mobile-h3.enableHttp1=true
blazemeter.http.profiles.mobile-h3.happyEyeballsDelayMs=500
blazemeter.http.profiles.mobile-h3.http3BrokenCooldownMs=600000
```

Profile IDs may contain lowercase letters, digits, `_`, and `-`. If `extends` is omitted,
the custom profile inherits from `browser-like`. Supported fields are:

`label`, `extends`, `enableHttp3`, `enableHttp2`, `enableHttp1`, `alpnEnabled`,
`fallbackEnabled`, `protocolErrorFallbackEnabled`, `altSvcCacheEnabled`,
`http1OnlyCacheEnabled`, `h2cCacheEnabled`, `http2PriorKnowledge`,
`h2cUpgradeEnabled`, `happyEyeballsDelayMs`, `http3BrokenCooldownMs`,
`http1OnlyCooldownMs`, and `h2cCacheTtlMs`.

For larger profile sets, put the same properties in a separate file and reference it:

```properties
blazemeter.http.profiles.file=/path/to/http-profiles.properties
```

Profile values defined directly in JMeter properties override values loaded from that file.


<a id="readme-client-protocols"></a>
#### Client Behavior → Protocols / Fallback / Cache / Timing

| **Control** | **What it does** |
|---|---|
| Enable HTTP/3 (Alt-Svc + QUIC) | Allows HTTP/3 when the origin advertises it via `Alt-Svc`. Typically requires `https` and UDP/QUIC reachability. |
| Enable HTTP/2 | Allows HTTP/2. Over TLS this is typically negotiated via ALPN. For cleartext origins see H2C options below. |
| Enable HTTP/1.1 | Allows HTTP/1.1. If disabled, the client will avoid HTTP/1.1 unless forced by server/proxy constraints. |
| H2C Upgrade (HTTP/1.1 Upgrade) | For cleartext (`http://`) origins, allow HTTP/1.1 → HTTP/2 (h2c) upgrade. Visible when HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are enabled. |
| Enable ALPN | Enables TLS ALPN for **HTTPS** (**HTTP/1.1** and **HTTP/2**). (**HTTP/3 discovery** uses **Alt-Svc**, not ALPN.) Cleartext **h2c** uses upgrade/prior-knowledge flows instead of TLS ALPN. |
| Automatic fallback | Enables automatic fallback between protocols (e.g. prefer HTTP/3, then fall back to HTTP/2/1.1 as needed). |
| Fallback on HTTP/2 protocol_error | If an HTTP/2 `protocol_error` occurs, retry using HTTP/1.1 (when fallback is enabled). |
| Alt-Svc cache | Caches `Alt-Svc` advertisements used for HTTP/3 discovery. |
| HTTP/1.1-only cache (HTTPS) | Caches “this HTTPS origin should be treated as HTTP/1.1-only” after failures, to avoid repeated negotiation overhead. |
| H2C cache (HTTP) | Caches h2c capability for cleartext origins. |
| HTTP/2 prior knowledge for cleartext (h2c) | Forces HTTP/2 prior knowledge (h2c) for cleartext origins, skipping the upgrade dance. Use only if you know the server speaks h2c. |
| Happy Eyeballs delay (ms) | When trying HTTP/3, delay before starting HTTP/2 in parallel (H3+H2) to reduce latency while avoiding extra connections. |
| HTTP/3 broken cooldown (ms) | How long to consider HTTP/3 “broken” for an origin after failures before retrying. |
| HTTP/1.1-only cache TTL (ms) | How long to keep the “HTTP/1.1-only” decision for an HTTPS origin. |
| H2C cache TTL (ms) | How long to keep the “h2c supported” decision for a cleartext origin. |


<a id="readme-timeouts"></a>
#### Timeouts (milliseconds)

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| Connect | Milliseconds to wait for a connection to open. |
| Response | Milliseconds to wait for a response. |


<a id="readme-proxy-server"></a>
#### Proxy Server

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| Scheme | Proxy scheme (typically `http`). |
| Server name or IP | Proxy host. |
| Port Number | Proxy port. |


<a id="readme-embedded-resources"></a>
#### Embedded resources

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| Retrieve All Embedded Resources | Parses HTML and downloads embedded resources (images, JS, CSS, etc.). |
| Parallel downloads | When enabled, embedded resources are fetched concurrently; “pool size = 1” forces synchronous behavior. |
| URLs must match | Regex filter for which embedded resources to download. |



<a id="readme-protocols-howto"></a>
### Protocols: how to use HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3

The simplest way is to pick a profile and only override when you need a specific behavior.

Common configurations:

- **Prefer HTTP/3, fallback to HTTP/2/1.1**: profile `browser-like` (default). Ensure **Enable HTTP/3** and **Automatic fallback** are enabled.
- **HTTP/2-only (TLS)**: disable **Enable HTTP/1.1**, disable **Enable HTTP/3**, keep **Enable HTTP/2** enabled. (For `https://` origins, ALPN typically must be enabled.)
- **HTTP/1.1-only**: keep **Enable HTTP/1.1** enabled, disable HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
- **Cleartext h2c (upgrade)**: use `http://` scheme, enable HTTP/1.1 + HTTP/2, and enable **H2C Upgrade**.
- **Cleartext h2c (prior knowledge)**: use `http://` scheme, enable HTTP/2, enable **HTTP/2 prior knowledge for cleartext (h2c)** (only if the server supports it).

> [!NOTE]
>
> HTTP/3 is **discovered via Alt-Svc** (and optionally cached), not via ALPN.


<a id="readme-buffer-capacity"></a>
### Buffer capacity

By default, the size of downloaded resources is limited to 2 MB (2,097,152 bytes); you can raise the limit by setting `blazemeter.http.maxBufferSize` in `jmeter.properties` or `user.properties` (value in bytes).


<a id="readme-alpn"></a>
### ALPN

The plugin uses **TLS ALPN** so HTTPS connections can advertise **HTTP/1.1** and **HTTP/2** (`h2`). **HTTP/3 discovery** is separate—it relies on **`Alt-Svc`** (see **Protocols** above), not TLS ALPN.

Cleartext **h2c** never uses TLS ALPN; negotiation uses **HTTP/1.1 Upgrade** or **prior knowledge**, matching the **`http://`** options described elsewhere in this README.

For TLS keystores/truststores, see JMeter’s [SSL Manager](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#SSL_Manager) and [Keystore Configuration](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Keystore_Configuration).


<a id="readme-auth-manager"></a>
### Auth Manager

Currently, we only support the Basic and Digest authentication mechanisms.

To use Basic preemptive authentication, set `blazemeter.http.auth.preemptive` to **`true`** in **`jmeter.properties`** or **`user.properties`**.



<a id="readme-multiplexing"></a>
### Multiplexing, HTTP/2, and overlapping sampler execution

**HTTP/2 multiplexing** means many requests can share **one TLS/TCP connection** as separate streams—the Jetty stack does this whenever negotiation selects HTTP/2.

**Overlapping sampler execution** (several BlazeMeter HTTP samplers in progress at once **within one thread iteration**) requires **`bzm - HTTP Async Controller`**. The concurrent cap follows **`blazemeter.http.maxConcurrentAsyncInController`** (default **100**) whenever **Limit max number of parallel executions** is unchecked. When limiting is checked, saves persist **Max parallel** as **`blazemeter.http.controller.maxConcurrentAsyncInController`**; unchecking restores the global cap at runtime whether or not stale values linger in the saved plan—see **[HTTP Async Controller](#readme-http-async-controller)** and **[Controller panel](#readme-http-async-panel)**. Tune **`blazemeter.http.maxRequestsPerConnection`** (default **100**) for Jetty concurrency per pooled connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Outside **`bzm - HTTP Async Controller`**, a Thread Group still runs BlazeMeter HTTP samplers **one after another** (the sampler returns before JMeter proceeds). That sequential **test-plan** pacing is orthogonal to HTTP/2 **transport** multiplexing.



<a id="readme-http-async-controller"></a>
# HTTP Async Controller

Add it with **Add → Logic Controller → bzm - HTTP Async Controller**. **`bzm - HTTP Sampler`** nodes that sit **directly under** this logic controller start their HTTP calls **without blocking each other**, so several requests can be **in flight at once within the same thread iteration**, up to the concurrency cap (**[Multiplexing, HTTP/2, and overlapping sampler execution](#readme-multiplexing)** and **[Controller panel](#readme-http-async-panel)** below).


![HTTP Async Controller demonstration](docs/http2-async-controller.gif)

<a id="readme-http-async-panel"></a>

| **Field** | **Description** | **Default** |
|---|---|---|
| Generate Parent Sample | Wraps child BlazeMeter HTTP results in one parent sample (sub-results in listeners/reports). | Off (`false`) |
| Limit max number of parallel executions | When **off**, the cap is **`blazemeter.http.maxConcurrentAsyncInController`**. When **on**, cap is **Max parallel** (saved in the `.jmx` only while this is on; runtime still uses the global cap when off). | Off (`false`) |
| Max parallel | Highest number of overlapping BlazeMeter HTTP samplers when limiting is **on** (integer ≥ **1**). Read-only when limiting is **off** (shows the effective global cap). | **100** (matches **`blazemeter.http.maxConcurrentAsyncInController`** unless you override; with limiting **on**, use the value you enter) |

In **View Results Tree**, rows may follow **completion order**, not test-plan order.

> [!NOTE]
> Anything else you add as a **direct child**—timers, a different sampler type, an assertion, another controller, etc.—still runs **in tree order**. Before that element runs, the controller **waits until every BlazeMeter HTTP request started above it has completed**. Use that pattern when you mean “kick off these BlazeMeter HTTP calls together, then run the following steps only after they are all done.”
